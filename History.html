<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<hr weight=80% align="center" size=4 color="black">
A graphics card is the component of a computer that is responsible in displaying text and images in the monitor. This piece of hardware can also come with other features which includes advanced rendering of 3D and 2D graphics, FireWire, video capture, MPEG-2/MPEG-4 decoding, TV-tuner adapter, light pen, TV output, or the capability to connect several monitors (multi-monitor). There are also high performance graphics card that are used for more graphically demanding functions like photo editing and computer games.

IBM released their first two video cards in 1981 with the IBM PC, the Monochrome Display Adapter (MDA) and Color Graphics Adapter (CGA). MDA works only in text mode which only prints ASCII characters and is able to represent 80 columns and 25 lines in the screen. This graphics card had only 4KB video memory and produces only the color green on black background. On the other hand, CGA was considered as IBM’s earliest color graphics card and earliest color computer display standard for IBM PC. CGA supported the same 80×20 text mode, 640-200 / 4 (resolution/ color) graphics mode and 16 KB of video memory. However, MDA became more popular in the market specifically for business purposes because of its higher resolution of text and the presence of printer port.

Van Suwannukul, founder of Hercules Computer Technology developed the first popular none IBM graphics card, the Hercules Graphics Card. Its difference from the MDA and CGA were its 720-348 / 2 (resolution/color) graphics mode and 64 KB video memory. What made it so popular was it both supported MDA compatible high resolution text mode and a monochrome graphics mode at the same time.

In the year 1984, Professional Graphics Controller (PGC) and Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA) were introduced by IBM. PGC was considered very advanced for its time with its capability of supporting 2D and 3D graphics acceleration for Computer Aided Design applications. This offered higher resolution and color depth than EGA.

Then by year 1987, came Video Graphics Array (VGA) which offered 640-480 / 16 (resolution/color) graphics mode and 256 KB of video memory. Though its resolution was replaced in PC markets by year 1990s, this is making fame on mobile devices. With its release, some corporations like Cirrus Logic, S3 and ATI decided in improving this video card’s number of colors used and its resolution. This interest led to what was called the Super VGA (SVGA). SVGA supported 2 MB of video memory and 1024×768 resolution at 256 color mode.

2D and 3D cards were first released to the public in 1995 which had the ability to illustrate multidimensional images which was not present during that time. These were mainly developed by Creative, Matrix and ATI.

In 1997, the Voodoo graphics chip was released which was widely accepted in gaming. It is said to be more powerful than any other cards released having 3D effects like Z-buffering, mip mapping and anti aliasing. Following Voodoo came more 3D video cards from NVIDIA which are Voodoo2, TNT and TNT2.

On the other hand, the AGP or Accelerated Graphics Port was developed by Intel to solve constrictions between the video card and microprocessor.

Graphics processor clock rate and 3D algorithms were mostly the focus of the continuous improvements of graphics cards from 1999 up to 2002 which were all from NVIDIA. This was the GeForce family which had until GeForce 4 version having the DDR technology and video memory of up to 128 MB.

By then since 2003, ATI video card market has been reined by ATI and NVIDIA with their Radeon and GeForce lines respectively.

         With the more demanding evolution of video graphics today, graphics cards keeps on meeting these needs. With the size of a computer chip, this hardware are now applied in new micro applications which includes iPods, notebook computers, phones, digital cameras and many others.
