<h1>Specifications</h1>
<hr width=80% align="center" size=4 color="black">* Memory bus width, measured in bits - the number of bits of information transmitted per clock. An important parameter in the performance of the card.
<p>* The amount of video memory, measured in megabytes - the amount of its own graphics memory. A larger volume does not always mean more performance.
Video cards integrated into the motherboard system chipset or being part of the CPU usually do not have their own video memory and use for their needs part of the computer's (UMA) memory.
</p><p>* core and memory frequencies - measured in megahertz, the more, the faster the video card will process the information.
</p><p>* texture and pixel fill rate, measured in million pixels per second, shows the amount of output information per unit of time.
</p><p>* card leads - MDA, Hercules, CGA and EGA video adapters were equipped with a 9-pin D-Sub type connector. Occasionally there was also a coaxial connector Composite Video, which allows you to output a black and white image to a television receiver or monitor equipped with a LF-video input. Video adapters VGA and later usually had only one VGA connector (15-pin D-Sub). Occasionally, early versions of VGA adapters also had a previous-generation connector (9-pin) for compatibility with older monitors. The choice of the working output was set by switches on the video adapter card. At present, the boards are equipped with DVI or HDMI connectors, or Display Port in the number from one to three. Some ATi video cards of the latest generation are equipped with six video outputs. Ports of DVI and HDMI are evolutionary stages in the development of the standard for video signal transmission, therefore, adapters can be used to connect devices with these types of ports. The DVI port is of two kinds. DVI-I also includes analog signals, allowing you to connect the monitor via the adapter to the D-SUB connector. DVI-D does not allow this. Dispay Port allows you to connect up to four devices, including speakers, USB hubs and other input-output devices. On the video card it is also possible to place composite and S-Video video outputs and video inputs (denoted as ViVo)
