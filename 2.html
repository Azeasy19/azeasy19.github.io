<h1 class="title">Nvidia RTX 2080 and RTX 2080Ti: Turing's best features&nbsp;explained</h1>
<p>After all the rush and excitement of Nvidia’s Turing launch at Gamescom, there’s now less than a week to go before those shiny new GeForce RTX graphics cards are out in the wild. On September 20 and 27, both the RTX 2080 and RTX 2080Ti will replace the GTX 1080 and GTX 1080Ti as Nvidia’s top dog bestest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/08/02/best-graphics-card-2018-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best graphics cards</a> – and the great thing is I can now finally tell you about all the other cool stuff they can do besides their fancy ray-tracing reflection gubbins.</p>
<p>You can now read my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/09/19/nvidia-geforce-rtx-2080-review/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 review</a>-in-progress (and my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/09/19/nvidia-geforce-rtx-2080ti-review/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080Ti review</a> here) for look at its performance figures, but rest assured, real-time ray tracing isn’t the only thing that makes these cards stand out. There’s also <strong>DLSS</strong>, Nvidia’s nifty deep learning anti-aliasing tech that uses AI to get up to double the performance of a GTX 1080. There’s also <strong>variable rate shading</strong>, which lightens the load on the GPU even further by simulating certain chunks of the environment and concentrating all the detail where it’s needed most, giving you even more performance and delicious frames per second. Then there’s the <strong>Nvidia Scanner</strong> for one-click overclocking, <strong>Ansel RTX</strong> for even prettier screenshots and a whole lot more – all explained here in (hopefully) non-techno jargon.</p>
<p>It’s all about speed, speed, speed on this here Turing train, but will it be enough to justify their huge cost? Here’s everything you need to know, including the RTX 2070, RTX 2080 and RTX 2080Ti’s price, specs and release date, as well as all the other tidbits I’ve gleaned from various developers and demo sessions. Let’s go.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Nvidia Turing RTX 2080 specs</h2>
<p>Lying at the heart of the RTX 20-series is Nvidia’s <strong>Turing GPU</strong>. Borrowing much of the same fancy gubbins as Nvidia’s professional <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/08/14/nvidia-turing-quadro-rtx-8000-6000-5000-specs-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quadro RTX</a> cards, including its <strong>RT Cores</strong> (or ray tracing cores), <strong>Tensor Cores</strong> (which are all to do with AI and deep learning bits and pieces) and <strong>Streaming Multi-processor</strong> (or SM processor, for short), the RTX line is as much about new technological features as it is about raw performance.</p>
<p>Accompanying the Turing GPU is a rather hefty dollop of <strong>GDDR6 RAM</strong>. The RTX 20-series will be the first graphics cards in the world to take advantage of this super fast memory, beating <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/06/29/amd-navi-gpu-release-date-specs-price-rumours/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMD’s Navi GPUs</a> well and truly to the punch. With at least 8GB of the stuff at their disposal, this should definitely help lift the cards’ respective speeds compared to their immediate predecessors. Here’s how they all shape up in handy graph form:</p>

<p>I’m not going to pretend to know what all these extra metrics actually mean, like Giga Rays and RTX (ray tracing) operations, because even Nvidia have admitted they had to invent new ones for Turing because it’s just so gosh-darned powerful compared to the GTX 10-series’ Pascal GPU. As a point of comparison, though, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/01/30/nvidia-geforce-gtx-1080ti-review-a-4k-monster-that-isnt-worth-the-extra-cash-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080Ti</a> can only do 1.21 Giga Rays/second. That makes the RTX 2080Ti around 8x more powerful in the old ray-tracing department.</p>
<p>In terms of display outputs, each card will also <strong>support 8K resolutions at 60Hz with HDR enabled</strong> – on a single screen, no less thanks to their DisplayPort 1.4a ready ports, as well as 4K at 60Hz via their HDMI 2.0b outputs. They’re also ready to support the new fancy USB-C tech, <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/virtuallink-consortium/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VirtualLink</a>. This will be of particular import for VR users, as it means the card’s USB-C output will be able to deliver all the power, display and all the data you need to use a VR headset from a single connector.</p>
<p>Nvidia’s also hoping their Turing cards will be an appealing prospect for streamers, too, as they’ll be able to <strong>encode 8K video at 30fps in HDR in real time</strong> for the first time, as well as get up to 25% bitrate savings when encoding with HEVC, and up to 15% savings in H.264. 4K streaming will also become a lot more practical, with Nvidia claiming you’ll get better performance than a typical x264 encoding setting you might be using today, with 1% dropped frames when streaming to Twitch at 4K using a 40K bitrate, compared to 90% via x264, and 1% CPU utilization compared to x264’s 73% at 4K over a 40K bitrate.</p>

<p class="wp-caption-text">Hope you’ve got a big-ass case to fit one of these things in…</p>

<h2>Nvidia Turing RTX 2080 ray-tracing: what is it and why should I care?</h2>
<p>Essentially a piece of really, <em>really</em> fancy light tech that makes shadows and reflections behave just how they do in real life, ray tracing is a big part of what makes Turing so special. It’s in the name of the graphics card, after all (RTX), and it’s not surprising Nvidia have focused almost all their attention on it since their initial announcement.</p>
<p>It’s not proper, <em>proper</em> ray tracing like you get in Pixar films, all told, but Nvidia’s AI boffins have pretty much given us the next best thing – as my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/08/24/nvidia-turing-rtx-2080-ray-tracing-metro-exodus-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview with Metro Exodus rendering programmer Ben Archard</a> can attest. It’s worth pointing out, though, that it’s still an extra feature developers will have to support rather than an inherent part of the card. Still, if even a fraction of games end up looking as good as Nvidia’s Sol ray tracing demo below, I’ll be very happy indeed.</p>
<div class="embed-wrapper"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KJRZTkttgLw?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" width="622" height="350" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<p>At the moment, there are just <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/08/21/nvidia-geforce-rtx-2080-turing-confirmed-pc-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a handful of confirmed games</a> that will be supporting the RTX 20-series’ ray tracing ability, but the demos I’ve seen so far have all been rather tasty looking, from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shadow of the Tomb Raider</a>‘s lively <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k12cf15VvV4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Day of the Dead scene</a> to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game/battlefield-v" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Battlefield V</a>‘s exploding tank fire in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DlF2EhuPkuQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eyes of your enemies</a>.</p>
<p>That said, with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/08/22/nvidia-turing-rtx-2080-performance-target-metro-exodus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metro Exodus team aiming for 60fps at just 1080p</a> with all of its ray tracing tech turned on, there are still a lot of questions that need to be answered regarding how much of an impact ray-tracing will have on a game’s overall performance.</p>
<h2>Nvidia Turing RTX cool feature #1: DLSS – what the heck is it and why is it important?</h2>
<p>Fortunately, Nvidia’s crammed a lot of other performance-boosting bits of AI tech inside their Turing RTX cards that will hopefully negate any potential ray-tracing impact if developers take advantage of them. Indeed, for all the attention given to ray-tracing over the last month or so, it isn’t actually nearly as interesting as all the other bits and pieces Nvidia’s Turing architecture offers as well.</p>
<p>Chief among them is DLSS, or Deep Learning Super Sampling. Nvidia teased this feature back at Gamescom with this rather vague but intriguing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/08/22/nvidia-turing-rtx-2080-vs-gtx-1080-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX 2080 vs a GTX 1080</a> performance graph, showing that games with DLSS enabled on an RTX 2080 will be able to deliver up to double the speed of a GTX 1080 at 4K. Now I can tell you how it actually works.</p>
<div id="attachment_582595" style="max-width: 6010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2018/08/TuringVsPascal_EditorsDay_Aug22_2.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-582595" src="https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2018/08/TuringVsPascal_EditorsDay_Aug22_2.png" alt="" width="622	" height="350" srcset="https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2018/08/TuringVsPascal_EditorsDay_Aug22_2.png 6000w, https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2018/08/TuringVsPascal_EditorsDay_Aug22_2-1212x682.png 1212w, https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2018/08/TuringVsPascal_EditorsDay_Aug22_2-760x428.png 760w" sizes="(max-width: 6000px) 100vw, 6000px" title=""></a><p></p>
<p class="wp-caption-text">It’s unclear what settings Nvidia used to get these performance stats, and what kind of frame rates that equates to, but what’s really astonishing is the speed boost provided by Turing’s other big feature, Deep Learning Super Sampling (the light green bar)</p>
</div>
<p>DLSS is pretty neat. In essence, it’s a super efficient form of anti-aliasing (AA) and uses Turing’s AI and deep-learning-stuffed Tensor Cores to help take some of the strain off the GPU. AA, in case you’re unfamiliar with the term, is a technique game makers use to make lines and edges appear smooth and natural instead of a million jagged pixels.</p>
<p>It’s particularly important when playing games at 4K, as more common AA techniques, such as temporal anti-aliasing (TAA), can often soften images a bit too much (negating that lovely sharp feeling 4K should bring) as well as get things a bit wrong when scenes are happening at speed. Whether you’ll notice any of this without the aid of a freeze-frame camera device, of course, is up for debate.</p>
<div id="attachment_590655" style="max-width: 2273px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2018/09/Nvidia-Turing-DLSS.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-590655" src="https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2018/09/Nvidia-Turing-DLSS.png" alt="" width="622" height="350" srcset="https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2018/09/Nvidia-Turing-DLSS.png 2263w, https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2018/09/Nvidia-Turing-DLSS-1212x682.png 1212w, https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2018/09/Nvidia-Turing-DLSS-760x428.png 760w" sizes="(max-width: 2263px) 100vw, 2263px" title=""></a><p></p>
<p class="wp-caption-text">Once Turing’s AI smarts have been trained with a special neural network dedicated that particular game (in this case, Epic’s taxing Infiltrator demo), DLSS games won’t just produce a more accurate picture, but they’ll also buy you extra frames in the process (click to enlarge).</p>
</div>
<p>But! DLSS isn’t just about making images look better. It’s about making images look better <em>and</em> booting the frame rate right up as well. By getting the AI to generate those super high resolution images instead of the GPU, DLSS frees up the GPU to concentrate on what it does best – pushing out all those lovely frames at delicious speeds.</p>
<p>Much like ray-tracing, however, DLSS is a separate feature that not only needs developer implementation, but input from Nvidia as well as they’re the ones that need to train their clever AI boffin machines on each individual game in the first place to make sure they’re doing everything properly. From what I’ve seen so far, though, DLSS is impressive stuff that makes a good first impression. If there’s enough uptake from developers to support it, it could be a major string to Turing’s bow and offer a substantial advantage over whatever AMD’s cooking up.</p>
