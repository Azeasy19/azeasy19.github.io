<h1>Details, structure</h1>
<hr weight=80% align="center" size=4 color="black">
A modern video card consists of the following parts:
<p>* The graphic processing unit (Graphics processing unit) - is engaged in calculations of the output image, freeing the central processor from this responsibility, calculating for the processing of 3D graphics commands. It is the basis of the graphics card, the speed and capabilities of the entire device depend on it. Modern graphics processors by complexity are not much inferior to the central processor of the computer, and often surpass it both in the number of transistors and in processing power, thanks to a large number of universal computing units. However, the GPU architecture of the previous generation usually assumes the existence of several blocks of information processing, namely: a 2D graphics processing unit, a 3D graphics processing unit, which in turn is usually divided into a geometric core (plus a vertex cache) and a rasterizer block (plus texture cache ) and etc.
</p><p>* Video controller - responsible for image formation in video memory, gives RAMDAC commands to generate sweep signals for the monitor and processes requests from the CPU. In addition, there is usually an external data bus controller (for example, PCI or AGP), an internal data bus controller and a video memory controller. The width of the internal bus and video memory bus is usually larger than the external (64, 128 or 256 bits versus 16 or 32), many video controllers also incorporate RAMDAC. Modern graphics adapters (ATI, nVidia) usually have at least two video controllers working independently of each other and controlling simultaneously one or more displays each.
</p><p>* Video memory - serves as a frame buffer, which stores an image generated and constantly modified by the GPU and displayed on the monitor (or multiple monitors). In the video memory, intermediate invisible image elements and other data are also stored. Video memory is of several types, differing in access speed and operating frequency. Modern video cards are equipped with DDR, DDR2, GDDR3, GDDR4 and GDDR5 memory. It should also be borne in mind that, in addition to video memory on the video card, modern graphics processors usually use part of the system's shared memory in their work, which is directly accessed by the video adapter driver via the AGP or PCIE bus. In the case of UMA architecture, a part of the computer's system memory is used as video memory.
</p><p>* Digital-to-analog converter (RAMDAC-Random Access Memory Digital-to-Analog Converter) - serves to convert the image generated by the video controller to the color intensity levels applied to the analog monitor. The possible color range of the image is determined only by the RAMDAC parameters. Most often RAMDAC has four main blocks - three digital-to-analog converters, one for each color channel (red, green, blue, RGB), and SRAM for storing data on gamma correction. Most DACs have a bit capacity of 8 bits per channel - obtained by 256 levels of brightness for each primary color, which in total gives 16.7 million colors (and due to gamma correction, it is possible to display the original 16.7 million colors in a much larger color space) . Some RAMDACs have a 10-bit bit capacity (1024 levels of brightness) for each channel, which allows to display more than 1 billion colors at once, but this possibility is practically not used. To support the second monitor, a second DAC is often installed. It should be noted that monitors and video projectors connected to the digital DVI output of the video card use their own digital-to-analog converters to convert the digital data stream and do not depend on the characteristics of the DAC of the video card.
</p><p>* Video ROM (ROM) - a read-only memory device with video BIOS, screen fonts, service tables, etc. The ROM is not used directly by the video controller - only the CPU is accessing it. The video BIOS stored in the ROM provides the initialization and operation of the video card before the main operating system is loaded, and also contains system data that can be read and interpreted by the video driver during operation (depending on the method used to separate the responsibility between the driver and the BIOS). On many modern cards, electrically reprogrammable ROMs (EEPROM, Flash ROM) are installed, which allow the user to overwrite the video BIOS with a special program.
</p><p>* cooling system - is designed to keep the temperature of the video processor and video memory within acceptable limits. The correct and full-featured work of the modern graphics adapter is provided with the help of a video driver - special software supplied by the graphics card manufacturer and downloaded during the launch of the operating system.
